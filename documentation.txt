Flexbox
Flexbox is a new module CSS3 that makes it easy to align elements to one another, in different and orders.
The main idea behind flexbox is to give the container the ability to expand and to shrink elements to use all the available spae.
Flexbox replaces float layouts, using less and more readable and logical code.
Flexbox completely changes the way that we build one-dimensional layouts.
